# How the recomendation works
  🤖 Our recommendation system employs **user-user collaborative filtering**, a technique that recommends products to a target user by identifying and leveraging the interests of similar users.<br>
  🤖 We utilize the **cosine similarity metric** to assess the degree of similarity in user interests, determining how closely their preferences align.<br>
